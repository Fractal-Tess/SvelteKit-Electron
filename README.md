# Overview

The aim of this project is to provide Web Developers using `svelte` the power to create cross-platform desktop apps using `electron`.

#### Core packages

**[`electron`](https://github.com/electron/electron)** > Electron is the core of this template.

**[`electron-forge`](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge)** > An awsome CLI that encapsulates a vast array of solutions for managing the electron application. It provides a set of tools for creating, packaging, bundling, distributing and more.

**[`electron-store`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-store#readme)** > A local storage manager, that writes/reads to storage files data to disk for later use.

**[`svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte)** > A radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app..

**[`svelte-kit`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit)** > SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a beautiful development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing.

**[`tailwindcss`](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)** > Tailwind CSS is basically a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override

**[`daisyUI`](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui)** > A plugin for Tailwind CSS. Faster development. Cleaner HTML. Customizable and themeable. Pure CSS.
